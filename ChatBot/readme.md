## Overview
This code is designed to build an AI-powered interactive assistant using **LangChain** and **Ollama**. The assistant has multiple tools for mathematical operations, online searches, and normal AI responses, all structured using LangChain’s tool framework.

## Breakdown of the Code

### 1. **Importing Required Libraries**
The script imports several libraries including `datetime`, `json`, `ollama`, `llm_axe`, and `langchain`. These are used for various functionalities such as LLM communication, time retrieval, and structured tool execution.

### 2. **Setting Up the LLM Model**
```python
model = ChatOllama(model="llama3.2:latest", keep_alive=1, format='json')
```
This initializes an **Ollama model** (`llama3.2:latest`) with JSON output formatting, ensuring structured responses.

### 3. **Defining Terminal Colors**
A dictionary named `terminal_colors` is created to manage colored output in the terminal for better readability.

### 4. **Defining Tools for AI**
Several **@tool** decorated functions are defined, each representing a different capability of the assistant:
- **Addition (`add`)** – Returns the sum of two numbers.
- **Multiplication (`multiply`)** – Returns the product of two numbers.
- **Subtraction (`subtract`)** – Returns the difference between two numbers.
- **Division (`devide`)** – Returns the quotient of two numbers.
- **use_Internet** – Uses an **online agent** to search the web for up-to-date information.
- **normal_usecase** – Handles standard queries without needing external data.
- **date** – Retrieves the current date and time.

Each tool prints output using terminal colors before returning the result.

### 5. **Rendering Tool Descriptions**
```python
render = render_text_description([add, subtract, multiply, devide, use_Internet, date, normal_usecase])
```
LangChain's `render_text_description` function is used to generate a textual description of all available tools.

### 6. **Creating the Chat Prompt**
```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([...])
```
The system defines a **chat prompt** that instructs the AI on how to behave, detailing the available tools and restricting it from using anything beyond them.

### 7. **Defining the Chain**
```python
chain = prompt | model | JsonOutputParser()
```
This combines the prompt with the model and an output parser, ensuring that responses are formatted in JSON with `name` (tool) and `arguments` (parameters) fields.

### 8. **Tool Selection & Execution**
```python
def selector(response):
    return globals()[response['name']].invoke(response['arguments'])
```
This function dynamically calls the tool based on the AI's response, allowing it to pick and execute the right function.

### 9. **User Interaction Loop**
The script enters a continuous loop where:
- It **accepts user input**.
- If the user types **`exit`**, it terminates.
- The query is passed to **LangChain** to determine the best tool to use.
- The JSON response is displayed as **debug information**.
- The selected tool is executed, and the response is printed.
- The conversation history is updated with user and AI messages.

### 10. **Error Handling**
A `try-except` block ensures that errors do not crash the program and are displayed to the user.

## Summary
This script effectively utilizes LangChain and Ollama to create an AI assistant with structured tool usage. It follows a **chain-based flow** where:
1. User inputs a query.
2. LangChain selects the best tool.
3. The selected tool is executed.
4. The result is displayed and stored in conversation history.
